Revision history for File-Edit-Portable

        - dir() method now uses File::Find::Rule for its ability to 
          specify maxdepth, which we do too
        - dir() takes wildcard globs in 'types' param in accordance with 
          File::Find::Rule::name

          we will return the platform's recsep
